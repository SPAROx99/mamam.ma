                    Philippines limits mobility, business in capital area over Omicron threat

                    <p class="text-light" style="margin-left: 3vh;"margin-left: 3vh;">MANILA: The Philippines will impose tighter curbs in the capital region for the next two weeks, the acting presidential spokesperson said on Friday (Dec 31), to try to limit infections by the Omicron coronavirus variant that is spreading globally. <br><br>

                        The health ministry on Friday recorded 2,961 new coronavirus infections, a two-month high, and reported a positivity rate of 10.3 per cent. <br><br>
                        
                        "In the coming days, we might see an increase in active cases," acting presidential spokesperson Karlo Nograles said in a televised announcement. <br><br>
                        
                        The region including the capital Manila is an urban sprawl of 16 cities that is home to more than 13 million people. It will be placed under the third of a five-scale alert system on Jan 3 to 15, Nograles said.</p>

                    Hong Kong ban on ivory sales comes into force
                </h1><br>
                <div class="col-12">

                    <p class="text-light " style="margin-left: 3vh;"margin-left: 3vh;">HONG KONG: A ban on selling most ivory products in Hong Kong came into effect on Friday (Dec 31), the culmination of a three-year process to eliminate the once rampant trade in the city. <br><br>

                        Hong Kong lawmakers in 2018 backed a Bill opting for a gradual phasing out of the trade - a move some conservationists at the time criticised as a loophole that could be exploited. <br><br>
                        
                        The city has been accused of playing an oversized role in the industry, with one 2019 report by a local conservation group saying that it accounted for around a fifth of all global ivory seizures in the last decade. <br><br>
                        
                        On the eve of the ban, small queues of shoppers were spotted outside some stores selling the product in the city's Sheung Wan district, according to local media reports. <br><br>
                        
                        Friday's new rules ban the "import, re-export and commercial possession of elephant ivory", but make an exception for antique pieces dating from before 1925.</p>

                    India's year of the unicorn: Start-ups in spotlight of 2021 tech boom

                    <p class="text-light" style="margin-left: 3vh;"margin-left: 3vh;">MUMBAI: Sumit Gupta has had a big year -- turning 30, getting married and seeing his start-up become one of India's newest tech unicorns. <br><br>

                        Hampered by the coronavirus pandemic and too busy expanding and getting funding for his cryptocurrency platform CoinDCX, his team finally grabbed a few days on the beach in Goa to celebrate recently. <br><br>
                        
                        "That was very delightful to everyone," Gupta told AFP. "It's been a very, very exciting journey. I've learned a lot ... The future of India is very bright." <br><br>
                        
                        This year 44 Indian unicorns - privately held startups valued at more than US$1 billion - were minted as investors piled money into a country long overlooked despite its vast potential. <br><br>
                        
                        Overseas funds put more than US$35 billion into Indian start-ups in 2021 - a tripling from 2020, according to data compiled by Tracxn - buying into everything from fintech and health to gaming.</p>

                    South Korea's disgraced ex-president Park freed after nearly 5 years in prison
                </h1><br>
                <div class="col-12">

                    <p class="text-light" style="margin-left: 3vh;"margin-left: 3vh;">SEOUL: Former South Korean president Park Geun-hye was released from prison on Friday (Dec 31) nearly five years after being convicted of corruption, fuelling debate over whether she would play any role ahead of a March presidential election. <br><br>

                        Park, 69, was the country's first democratically elected leader to be thrown out of office when the Constitutional Court upheld a parliament vote in 2017 to impeach her over a scandal that also led to the imprisonment of the chiefs of two conglomerates, Samsung and Lotte. <br><br>
                        
                        South Korea's top court in January upheld a 20-year prison sentence imposed after Park was found guilty of colluding with a friend, who is also in jail, to receive tens of billions of won from the companies, mostly to fund her friend's family and non-profit foundations. <br><br>
                        
                        President Moon Jae-in granted a special pardon to Park last week, citing her deteriorating health and expressing hope to "overcome unfortunate past history and promote national unity".</p>
